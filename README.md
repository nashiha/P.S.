# P.S.
We created a new programming language called P.S! P.S! is a letter-format drawing language. The main ideology behind P.S! is describing a drawing to a friend as if writing a letter. The language written is formal and polite. This is how you would draw an oval using P.S!:  Dear Kakubo,  Please,  Draw an oval.  Thank you!  We created a scanner and a parser for our language. You can see the scanner, parser, extended tutorial, reports, and sample programs in this repository
